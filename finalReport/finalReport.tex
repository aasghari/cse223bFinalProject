\textbf{Abstract} - This paper presents a multicast system that guarantees
a strong consistency among a small group of nodes, providing fault
tolerance, while maintaining weaker consistency between the groups,
which allows for greater performance. The system consists of key-value
store that is built with a multicast protocol in conjunction with
Gas Friends application, which is a simple interface that is used
to show the functionality of the system. The papers proves by experiments,
that the system shows a significant enhancement in performance compared
with the standard multicast protocol.

\section{Introduction}

Knowing the goal of the system is a key aspect to build an efficient
system that meets the requirement of the system. This paper presents
a multicast system that is built for Gas Friends (GF) application.
GF’s main goal is to provide a fast and consistent updated for gas
prices in each city in U.S . That means, when a user open the application
and choose San Diego city, if the user is in San Diego then he belongs
to the set of primary users of San Diego page. The set of primary
users will have a strong consistency view of the list of prices. On
the other hand, users in different geographical locations such as
New York are considered to be secondary users for San Diego prices’
page, which means they will not “directly” benefit from San Diego
page and, most probably, will not visit that page, then the need to
have a strong consistent view could be compromised. Our system utilized
this fact to enhance the performance by minimizing the round trip
time, which is an important factor in transformation delay in other
systems.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Motivation}

The system is developed taking in consideration the user as the center
of the focus. In application like GF, the goal, mainly, is to serve
the first tier users and this makes the application deals with different
groups of users that are constructed according to the physical presents
which ends up to have the same user to be a primary in one group and
a secondary in another. The set up for those group was the real motivation
to create such a system that broadcast the message to all users but
to wait for the acknowledgment from the primary users only.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Environment Set-up}

MiniNet \cite{minimet} is the network simulation environment that
we used to run the system, and it simulate a typical real-world network
where netwrok failures can occur and may result in one or more nodes
being partitioned. On the other hand, we assume that a levers the
seas a ware of the subset for each Clique. In addition, we assume
that the hard disc contents will never be lost. The language we used
to implement the system is C++. The system interface (GF)is built
with PHP. The client-server that we implemented are implemented with
thrift-0.9.0 and compiled with GCC 4.4.

\section{Description of Our Multicast Protocol}

In general, the system consists of sets of Cliques; each set has a
Master Node and a group of server nods. We believe that using a primary
to commit data is more attractive than the standard two phase commit
protocol since it alleviates the need to gather a majority quorum
of servers \cite{bayou}. As a result, and by knowing the application's
specifications, the system was built to adopt a week consistency outside
the Clique and a strong one inside it. The client sends a request
to the Master Node, and the Master Node multicasts the request to
all nods inside and outside its Clique, but the Master Node will wait
for acknowledgment from the nods inside its Clique only.


\subsection{The Master Node}

The system will consist of number nodes (all trusted) each is independently
accessible to outside clients. When a client accesses a node, that
node is known as the Master Node for that client. At any given time
there will be at most as many Master Nodes as clients in system, but
may be fewer as multiple clients may share the same Master Node.


\subsection{The Clique Nodes}

The nodes of the system will be organized into cliques of size n.
A Master Node within a clique will multicast client requests to all
nodes in the system, however will only require a response from member
of it’s clique. If a clique member fails to reply in a designated
time t, the Master Node will re-multicast the message and increase
the timeout t by a random value before retrying. In the event a maximum
number of retries are executed, the Master Node will select another
node from the system to join it’s clique and continue if that node
responds. In the event that n clique-mates cannot be found, the Master
Node, for our purposes, will fail the client’s request. Note that
this failure does not imply the message has not been committed by
any nodes, simply that the Master Node cannot guarantee the fault
tolerance agreement with the client. The master node will not advance
its clock in the event of a failure.


\subsection{The Non-Clique Nodes}

Nodes outside the clique may or may not receive messages, receive
duplicate messages or receive messages out-of-order from Master Node.
These will be handled silently by the non-clique members. Any messages
received can be immediately committed.


\subsection{The Heartbeat}

enforcing a global order on tentative as well as committed messages
ensure that isolated servers will come to agreement on resolution
of any conflict that they encounter \cite{bayou}.To ensure an individual
node has not become completely isolated from the system, it will occasionally
send a heartbeat request to a random node in the system along with
it’s current vector clock. In the event the other nodes vector clock
matches, an okay message is sent. In the event the two clocks don’t
match the node with newest clock will send the last message it received
which will cause the other node to initiate the algorithm described
Fault Tolerance section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Fault Tolerance}

Since the system simulate the real-world network, fault tolerance
is addressed. In the event a non-clique member hears a message from
a Master Node which a timestamp significantly newer than the last
known timestamp (i.e much high clock value), the node will assume
it’s is missing data. To retrieve this data it will begin with it’s
own clique-mates. In the event none of it’s clique -mates have the
data, it will contact fixed number of nodes at random asking if any
of them have the missing data. Lastly if all else fails, it will contact
a node within the Master Node’s Clique (this set of nodes includes
the Master Node) which is guaranteed to have the missing data since
the Master Node will not send a new message until all of it’s clique-mates
are up to speed. If a request makes it way all the way to the Master
Node’s clique, it will be multicast to all nodes since if things got
this far, it is assumed a number of other nodes are missing the data
as well.

The major addition is to avoid to avoid the delay and communication
overhead when loosing data. Applying this technique limit the scope
of solicitations and repairs, in the hope of repairing problems where
they occur \cite{twoScal}. One thing to note about this, is that
by contacting other nodes asking for missing data, you are also spreading
knowledge that data has gone missing. Any node receiving a message
for which it cannot supply the missing data (since it is missing it
as well) will begin with the same algorithm after a random delay to
allow for the event that the original node will have to contact the
Master Node’s clique and thus result in the re-multicasting of the
message anyway.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Experiments}

The system has been tested using MiniNet simulation environment. Two
scenarios were tested. First, if the system send a multicast message
to all nodes and wait for acknowledgment from all nodes, Second, if
the system send a multicast message to a clique (subset group of nodes)
and wait for acknowledgment from the nodes in the clique only. In
the second scenario, the size of the clique is selected to be 5 ,10
and 15 nodes.

The result shows that by using cliques we were able to reduce the
time needed by factor of x in the case of 15 nodes, factor of y in
case of 10 and by factor of z in case we used 5 nodes per clique.
The result is demonstrated in Table \ref{tab:result}

\section{Conclusion }

In our work environment where we insists on having a strong consistency
among set of serveer nodes and a weaker consistency between the sets,
the paper provided a customized multicast protocol that showed a great
enhancement on the performance when it compared to the standard multicast
protocol.


\section{Future Work}


\subsection{The Synchronization Protocol}

Synchronization Protocol which will essentially enforce that all nodes,
or a subset of nodes, synchronize all of their data before accepting
any new client requests.


\subsection{Choosing a Node }

Assuming a good number of nods that are connected to the same switch
will get the same message from the multicast will give us the ability
to choose different node in case of not getting a respond from a node
in the Clique.
